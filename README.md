# Faster R-CNN Object Detection on VOC2012

This repository contains code to train an object detection model using the Faster R-CNN architecture on the VOC2012 dataset. We experiment with different backbones for the Faster R-CNN model and compare their results.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:
1. **Data Loading and Parsing**: The VOC2012 dataset's annotations are parsed and loaded into a format suitable for training the object detection model.
2. **Custom Backbone**: A custom CNN backbone is defined for feature extraction. The architecture contains four convolutional layers.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Utility functions and classes are defined to facilitate model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

## Results

The models show varying results based on the complexity of their architectures:

- **Custom Backbone**: This model uses a custom-defined backbone with four convolutional layers. While it trains properly, it's relatively less complex and struggles with both object misclassification and incorrect localization.
  
- **Pre-trained Backbone (ResNet50 with FPN)**: A variant of the Faster R-CNN model that leverages the pre-trained ResNet50 architecture with Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) as its backbone. This model showcases superior results compared to the custom backbone model.

Notably, for simple images — such as those with a white background and a distinct object in the center — localization is more accurate.

## Future Improvements and Works

There are several avenues for further improvement:

1. **Complexity Enhancement**: The custom backbone can be made deeper or modified to include more advanced architectural components, potentially improving feature extraction capabilities.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Introducing more sophisticated data augmentation techniques can help the model generalize better, especially for challenging scenarios.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: A thorough search for the optimal set of hyperparameters can potentially boost model performance.
4. **Transfer Learning**: Using weights from models trained on larger datasets (like ImageNet) as initialization can lead to faster convergence and potentially better results.
5. **Integration with Advanced Architectures**: Exploring architectures like EfficientDet or YOLOv4 might yield better results due to their advanced design considerations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure dependencies (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.) are installed.
3. Run the main script to train and evaluate the models on the VOC2012 dataset.
4. Inspect results and compare between models.
